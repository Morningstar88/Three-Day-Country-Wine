# Three-Day-Country-Wine
Beautiful Bali Wine

Arise... ancient thread.

They have awesome Arak in Bali. In Cambodia, they make their whiskey from car tyres, I guess. Full of methanol.

But the local fruit wine is good. 

I want to learn how to make 3 day wine. I had some in Bali, it was amazing.

I don't even know the basics of fermentation. What a dumb first worlder I am.

NOTES

- To activate yeast. 1 tbsp dry yeast, 1 tbsp sugar. 1:1 ratio. Warm water. 
- Mix and keep aside for 10 minutes. It'll turn bubbly.
- The optimum temperature range for yeast fermentation is between **90˚F-95˚F (32˚C-35˚C)** . Every degree above this range depresses fermentation.
- In the above video, they mix the yeast separately and add it to the grapes mixture.
- Cover with clean cloth and keep aside.
- On day two, the wine and grapes should separate.
- Add two teaspoons of wheat on day two.
- Strain and filter.

HOW TO BREW ALCOHOL IN 30 SECONDS

https://youtu.be/t9OHf7weO9I

- Pour juice into a blender.
- Add sugar. Blend.
- Get brewers yeast. Sprinkle it in. 
- Put brewers cap on. 
- COMMENT "Yes the cap uses a pressure valve to release a measured amount of pressure to allow the drink to carbonate whilst simultaneously preventing any kind of bottle explosion from the gas build up. And you're right, anything that gets people into homebrewing is a good thing. Cheers!"
- Leave it safe, and out of sunlight for a few days.

TOO SWEET

I’m not convinced it’s possible to make anything drinkable in three days. Yes, the primary fermentation may well finish in that short time period, but it will be still cloudy with yeast and it’s going to have all kinds of weird flavours in it that will take time to mellow out. Patience, young grasshopper!

Few tips for brewing pretty much anything:

Do separate your primary and secondary fermentation (the secondary fermentation really isn’t even fermentation, it’s the yeast sort of winding up it’s activity and going to sleep).
If you’re making wine, leave it to mellow for weeks or months until it’s drinkable. It takes as long as it takes. Beer is ready on much shorter timescales (a couple of weeks to couple a months).
Use an actual wine or beer yeast. Bread yeast will sort-of work but you won’t get much alcohol in it and it won’t taste great.
Distilled spirits that taste like crap or have methanol in them are just down to poor distillation technique, not the stuff they started with. You can ferment almost anything and the distilled end result will taste more-or-less OK as long as you discard most of the flavour components during distillation (which basically means the first and last bits).

You need some serious kit (multistage reflux condenser optimized for alcoholic products) to produce good-quality distilled spirits. A moonshine setup will be a long way off optimal.
