They have awesome Arak in Bali. In Cambodia, they make their whiskey from car tyres, I guess. Full of methanol.

But the local fruit wine is good.

I want to learn how to make 3 day wine. I had some in Bali, it was amazing.

I don’t even know the basics of fermentation. What a dumb first worlder I am.

NOTES

To activate yeast. 1 tbsp dry yeast, 1 tbsp sugar. 1:1 ratio. Warm water.
Mix and keep aside for 10 minutes. It’ll turn bubbly.
The optimum temperature range for yeast fermentation is between 90˚F-95˚F (32˚C-35˚C) . Every degree above this range depresses fermentation.
In the above video, they mix the yeast separately and add it to the grapes mixture.
Cover with clean cloth and keep aside.
On day two, the wine and grapes should separate.
Add two teaspoons of wheat on day two.
Strain and filter.
